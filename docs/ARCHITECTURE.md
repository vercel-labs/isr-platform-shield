# Shielded ISR Multi-Tenant Architecture

A comprehensive guide to the shielded ISR multi-tenant platform architecture, including system capabilities, request flows, cache strategies, and deployment protection mechanisms.

## Overview

The Shielded ISR Multi-Tenant Platform is a sophisticated architecture that solves the critical problem of cache invalidation during deployments in multi-tenant applications. The system provides:

- **Cache Protection**: Serves cached content while Core app ISR cache rebuilds after deployment
- **Cache Pre-warming**: Enables safe cache warming after deployment
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Subdomain-based tenant isolation with dynamic routing
- **Deployment Safety**: Prevents slow first requests during critical post-deployment periods

### The Solution

The Shielded ISR architecture introduces a protective cache layer that:

- **Protects During Deployments**: Serves cached static content while Core app rebuilds
- **Enables Safe Pre-warming**: Allows cache warming after deployment mith minimal user impact
- **Supports Multi-Tenancy**: Handles subdomain routing with granular cache invalidation

## System Components

### Shield

**Purpose**: Provides cache protection and routing for the multi-tenant platform

**Components**:

- **Vercel CDN Cache**: Controls behavior of responses
- **Compute**: Cache management

### Core

**Purpose**: Generates pages and handles multi-tenant content

**Components**:

- **Vercel CDN Cache**: Edge caching for static assets
- **ISR**: 60-second revalidation for dynamic pages
- **Compute**: Page generation and data access
- **Data Access**: Direct access to Redis and file system

#### Data Layer

**Components**:

- **Redis**: Subdomain data storage and configuration
- **File System**: Blog posts and static content
